This site uses out-of-the-box [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/ "Twitter Bootstrap") framework components, including media carousels, dropdown menus, sticky navbars, list-groups, and modals. Glyph icons are included using Bootstrap and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ "Font Awesome"). CSS3 is straight-forward and does not currently use a Sass preprocessor. jQuery is included locally but referenced initially from the CDN-delivered version.
